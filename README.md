# MCserverBot
Simple little Minecraft server Discord bot to run in parallel with a Minecraft server. Ask it for the IP.



# Quickstart
## 1. Purchase Minecraft. 
Minecraft is available for purchase through various venues. PC Version for EN/US region is available [here](https://minecraft.net/en-us/store/?ref=m). After purchasing, download it to your PC and set up an account. I'm not going to explain anymore. This should all be a little self-explanatory.
## 2. Join Twitch
[Twitch](https://app.twitch.tv/download) is a streaming service that also provides some other fun tools. Of these, pre-built modpacks - colections of mods all organized so they don't mess each other up - are the ones we're interested in. Download the desktop client linked to here then: 
- Go to **Mods**.
- Go to **Browse All Modpacks**
- Search for "*Enigmatica 2*"
- Install Enigmatica 2 version 1.5.7 (It should state that it's compatible with Minecraft 1.12.2)
- Try to run Engmatica 2 on singleplayer.
  - It might take some time to start up; it's loading 200+ mods at once. Give it a little. Especially if you're machine is doing other things at the same time.
  - If it crashes while starting up or running, make sure you've allocated enough RAM to run the whole thing. To do this, through Twich, On the Engimatica 2 page:
    - Click the **...** button in the upper-right. 
    - Select **Profile Options**
    - Drag the slider somewhere that makes everything work. Might take trial and error. Might take math. Enigmatica 2 likes 5-8 **GB** of RAM. [Here's a handy calculator.](https://www.unitconverters.net/data-storage/mb-to-gb.htm) 
             
## 3. Connect to the Server
After you've got everything working on your machine, it's time to connect to the server. From the multiplayer menu, join the server using the address **weesnaw.ddns.net**. You should be able to go from there.
