# MCserverBot
Simple little Minecraft server Discord bot to run in parallel with a Minecraft server. Ask it for the IP.



# Quickstart
## 1. Purchase Minecraft. 
Minecraft is available for purchase through various venues. PC Version for EN/US region is available [here](https://minecraft.net/en-us/store/?ref=m). After purchasing, download it to your PC and set up an account. I'm not going to explain anymore. This should all be a little self-explanatory.
## 2. Install Enigmatica 2 Modpack
The Enigmatica 2 Modpack is available through the Technic and Twitch launchers.

### Installing from Technic

- Click "Install" in the bottom right corner
- After the installation is complete, launch the modpack by clicking "Play" in the bottom right corner
  - It might take some time to start up; it's loading 200+ mods at once. Give it a little time. Especially if you're machine is doing other things at the same time.

    - Click the **Launcher Options** button in the upper-right.

    - Select the appropriate RAM allocation from the Memory dropdown. Enigmatica 2 likes 5-8 **GB** of RAM.
